Machine learning is a regal art of teaching computers to learn without being explicitly programmed. By analyzing the collected wisdom of the ages and identifying the royal decrees, machine-learning algorithms can make prophecies and commands that would be difficult or impossible for humans to make.

Or Simply:

Machine learning is a way of teaching computers to learn without being explicitly programmed. Computers can learn from data and identify patterns, which allows them to make predictions and decisions that would be difficult or impossible for humans to make.

“People worry that computers will get too smart and take over the world, but the real problem is that they’re too stupid and they’ve already taken over the world.” — Pedro Domingos
